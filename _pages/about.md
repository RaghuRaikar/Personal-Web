As a computer science student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, I have built a solid foundation in programming languages like Java, Python, and C++. My skills also extend to web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have practical experience with databases and version control systems.

My primary interest lies in artificial intelligence and machine learning, where I am eager to apply and expand my expertise. I enjoy solving coding challenges and training AI models, and I am committed to staying updated with the latest advancements in the field. I am enthusiastic about contributing my skills to innovative projects in AI/ML and continuing to grow in this exciting area..
