I'm thrilled to share my experience as a speaker at the NASA Better Together 2023 conference hosted at the San Jose Convention center. I got to speak on the work I did with my team on our application: celestial mapping system, an application crafting virtual 3D globes for solar system bodies. I was able to connect with many different individuals each with their own unique journey to NASA. Glad to be a part of the Artemis generation, contributing to the future of space exploration!
