I am proud to say that I have completed the CodePath 10-week iOS development course. During the course, I used Xcode and learned the Swift programming language to build and test many apps. It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and I am excited to continue using my new skills to create more apps and further my development as an iOS developer.
